          or specify a range like A1:A100

Problem: Nothing happens when I click results
Solution: Check if Excel is still open and the workbook wasn't closed


YOUR v1.0 IS SAFE:
------------------
• We created v2.0 as a SEPARATE file
• v1.0 still works exactly as before
• Both use the same search algorithm
